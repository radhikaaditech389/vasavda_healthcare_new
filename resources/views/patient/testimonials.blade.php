                                                     my gynaecologist. She is incredibly knowledgeable and understanding, always
                                                     taking the time to explain everything in detail. Dr. Mitali Vasavada made me
                                                      feel comfortable and at ease throughout my visits. Her patience and dedication
                                                       were evident, especially when she tried her best to ensure a normal delivery.
                                                       I highly recommend her to anyone seeking a caring and competent healthcare

                                                    I visited Dr. Mitali Vasavada and her clinic for the same.
                                                     I presented my case and my reports from my previous physician,
                                                     She wanted to perform her own examination, she was very thorough and once
                                                      she found that I needed a hysterectomy, she helped us with pre-op and
                                                       procedures and guided us through the requirements that needed to be
                                                        fulfilled prior to the surgery. She was immediate to respond to my
                                                         concerns regarding the post-op care and has provided consultation
                                                          via WhatsApp also. She's extremely professional and extremely kind
                                                          towards her patients. If you're looking for a gynecologist,
