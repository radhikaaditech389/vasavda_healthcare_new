                                        <p>A birth plan is a systematic record of your preferences for labour and delivery . It is made in accordance to your unique case and is individualised as per your medical , surgical history and in keeping with your cultural ,social circumstances and your wishes . This also comes in handy if you come in an emergency as the staff can go through the document and administer the care to you faster.</p>

As per studies , presence of a doula at birth increases the chance of normal vaginal birth and reduces the chances of interventions . This also has shown to reduce the need to provide analgesia (pain relief ).</p>

                                        <p>A normal birth is called normal if the labour pains have started spontaneously at or after term (37 weeks ), have continued to go on till delivery of the baby head first (vertex) with no tear of the perineum . It may not be possible to achiev all this in every delivery . however our aim is to aid natural birth and stick to minimum intervention at all times. While this is the case , some conditions such as a contracted pelvis , placenta praevia , severe high blood pressure , cardiac problems and some others are absolute contraindications to having a vaginal birth and we wouyld advice you if such is the case in advance .
                                            Apart from this sometimes , during normal labour , there may be emergencies such as baby ‘s heart beat slowing down etc where in order to ensure well being of mother and baby we may need to convert to a c –section in best interest of the patients . these however would be discussed and joint decision taken by patient and doctor.
